<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [electromagnetics summit 2023] <a name="about-project"></a>

> Here I have wrote a web page for a conference on electromagnetism. Only the
main page and the about page are completed. 

**[your_project__name]** is a web application with the following features:

It has 2 pages:

-The home page.
-The about page.
Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

-Mobile: up to 768px wide.
-Desktop: 768px or wider.

--Interactions

-Links
The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
The logo in the header links to the home page.

-Mobile menu
When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.

-Dynamic page

The section "Featured speakers" is created dynamically in JavaScript.
